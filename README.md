* ADVANCED APP DESIGN    
- The main goal of this mini-project is to inspire you on what we can accomplish with the SwiftUI framework.

* COMPLEX SWIFTUI GESTURES     
- Create such a custom button with complex gestures that we can not find in Appleâ€™s stock user interface library.

* PARALLAX EFFECT     
- By using multiple movements in the opposite direction (parallax effect), we can add depth to this amazing onboarding screen.

* AVFoundation      
- SDK to play sound
